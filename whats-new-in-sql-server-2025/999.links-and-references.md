## [Ollama SQL FastStart](https://github.com/nocentino/ollama-sql-faststart/)

Ollama SQL FastStart is a Docker-based project designed to simplify the setup and management of a SQL Server 2025 environment integrated with Ollama services. It offers a preconfigured environment for running SQL Server and Ollama, while also serving requests through NGINX with SSL support. Additionally, it configures SQL Server to trust this SSL certificate.
